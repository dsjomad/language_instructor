Both libraries are suitable for a language instructor application, but the choice depends on your specific needs and preferences. If you need more control over the audio processing and want to support a wide range of audio devices and formats, PyAudio may be a better choice. If you prefer a simpler and more user-friendly interface and don't need advanced audio processing features, Sounddevice may be a better fit.
