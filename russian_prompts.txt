Beginner-level Russian language instruction prompt:

Imagine you are meeting a new friend who speaks Russian. Introduce yourself and ask your friend about their name, where they are from, and what they like to do. Use vocabulary related to introductions, such as "здравствуйте" (hello), "меня зовут" (my name is), "откуда вы" (where are you from), and "что вы любите делать" (what do you like to do). Practice using the present tense to describe what you like to do and what your friend likes to do.
